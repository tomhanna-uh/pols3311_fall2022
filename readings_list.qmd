Readings List Introduction to Comparative Politics: POLS 3311 Fall 2022 . Summary The following are required, recommended, and additional readings on the various course topics, arranged by topic. Inclued are notes on relevance, pages of interest, relationships between the readings, and selections from the readings or abstracts, etc. I have renamed the files as much as possible to match the titles listed here. You may find the notes on the readings useful in reviewing the topics for the midterm and final exam. Background Material This section includes background material on topics including definitions of core concepts (politics, the state, rationality, science), examples of comparative studies (case studies, small-n, and large-n), material on studying comparative politics, etc. Background and definitions Shepsle, Kenneth. "Rationality: The Model of Choice." Analyzing Politics: Rationality, Behavior, and Institutions. This oers a an explanation of what is meant by rationality in the context of rational choice models, and this course. It is important to understand that rational has a definition that may not match the way that you have heard it used in casual conversation. Specifically, rationality as defined by Shepsle means that the behavior of the actor is in keeping with his preferences and beliefs. In casual conversation we may judge someone's beliefs or preferences as irrational, but that kind of value judgement is not relevant in this definition of rationality. Instead the question is does their behavior make sense given what they prefer and believe. (shepsle analyzing politics.pdf) Riker and Ordeshook. "Introduction: The Meaning of Politics." Introduction to Positive Political Theory. Riker and Ordeshook. Examining the question, "what is politics?" Riker and Ordeshook arrive at a definition of political science based on how collective choice is derived from individual preferences. Examples Acmoglu, Daron and James Robinson. "So Close and Yet So Dierent." from Why Nations Fail. This is an excellent example of a narrative comparative study of two cities separated only by a national border: Nogales, Arizona, USA and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. The chapter describes their similarities and dierences. This is an excellent example of what you should do if you choose to write a paper comparing two political entities, though on a smaller scale. (acemoglu why nations fail.pdf) 1 Readings List Introduction to Comparative Politics: POLS 3311 Fall 2022 1 Collective Choice These papers are primarily for the Collective Choice section, but the recommended readings especially will have relevance to other topics throughout the semester. Collective Choice: Required Introduction to: A Behavioral Approach to the Rational Choice Theory of Collective Action, Elinor Ostrom 1997 Presidential Address to the American Political Science Association. Collective Choice: Recommended • F.A. Hayek - The Pretense of Knowledge. (1974 Nobel Prize Lecture) -- Introduction, look for headings/keywords and phrases -- Hayek was the a Nobel prize winning economist who worked in multiple disciplines including political economy, institutional politics, history, and law. Here Hayek argues that economists specifically, and social and life scientists generally, err in assuming that they can be as successful in making precise mathematical predictions as the physical sciences. He argues that social phenomena are "essentially complex." That is, there are so many variables at play, often with intricate feedback mechanisms, that while we can build excellent elegant models for explaining general cause and eect, we can't be so arrogant as to oer absolute powers of prediction for specific policies. (One important eect of this is that it is quite likely that there will be unpredictable unintended consequences to particular policies.) He emphasizes the importance of Karl Popper's idea of falsifiability as being particularly important in the face of this essential complexity. • Ostrom - Beyond Markets and States: Polycentric Systems of Governance of complex economic systems (2009 Nobel Lecture) -- Introduction, headings of interest, conclusion, figures and notes -- This lecture/article builds on the APSA lecture by Ostrom. Without getting too deep in the technical aspects a few key points are worth mentioning. Ostrom emphasizes the increasing complexity of descriptions. For example in "Doubling the type of goods," she describes the addition of club goods and using more precise terminology than "rivalry of consumption." This is a good example of Hayek's idea of essential complexity. For those with questions about the typology we discussed in class, some of this may give further insight. Bear in mind that for some purposes the simpler model serves well, while the more complicated model can explain the outlier cases. Our goal in science typically is to use the simplest model that explains the observed facts. Ostrom and Hayek both argue that, in specific cases, either that more complex models serve better or that suciently complex models are not possible. Ostrom's analysis of complexity goes beyond types of goods to institutional structures and, especially, to alternate modes of collective action. 2 Readings List Introduction to Comparative Politics: POLS 3311 Fall 2022 • Collective Choice - Schwartz. -- page 151, remainder as useful -- A relatively simple narrative explanation of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Provided as background material for those who want additional information or want to address these sorts of problems in papers. Page 151 describes the theorem. The explanation is decent, but the wording is the same technical jargon used by Arrow so is intimidating. For those covering this topic, understanding the basics on page 151 would be especially useful (and may require looking for further reading using this as a base). Collective Choice: Potential readings for papers: • The choice of institutions to solve cooperation problems: a survey of experimental research. -- Experimental research into collective choice cooperation problems involving prisoners' dilemmas, public goods games, and common pool resource games. • Building local institutions for national conservation programs: lessons for developing Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programs -- Article examing REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programs using the Ostrom principles. • Collaborative Governance of Climate Change Adaptation Across Spatial and Institutional Scales -- Examines how joint participation in policy forums translates into policy actions, but are more likely to result in collaboration if the forums sponsor lower level operational coordination rather than higher level collective action. • Collective Action and Systemic Corruption - Marquette and Peifer -- Two presentations by same authors - two files -- Authors examine the supposed failure of collective choice theory to expain systemic corruption, arguing that collective choice theory is appropriate as an adjunct rather than alternative to principal-agent theory subject to consideration of available resources. -- In the "DLP" file piece, they address "The problem with viewing corruption as only a 'problem'" • Decentralization Can Increase Cooperation among Public Ocials -- This research uses a natural experiment to address cooperation among public ocials. One of the findings of Ostrom's research was that so-called "cheap talk," which is generally viewed as ineective by formal theorists (game theorists), can be eective in generating cooperation even absent higher authority. This research has similar findings as communication combined with decentralization of authority results in 3 Readings List Introduction to Comparative Politics: POLS 3311 Fall 2022 increased cooperation. "When they are able to communicate, health sector workers in decentralized municipalities contribute more to a public good than their centrallyadministered counterparts." • Encounters with the Moral Economy of Water: Convergent Evolution in Valencia -- An examination of the success of voluntary locally governed water cooperatives in allocating irrigation water in a way that assures full share distribution and low to non-existent levels of theft (cheating) without bureaucratic (state) intervention. • FOUR-WAY STOPS -- Might be of interest for this or future topics -- This is a formal theory or game theory piece, but could produce testable results. -- How would you propose testing the authors' conclusions? -- "This paper investigates mechanisms for ensuring orderly passing at crossroads. We challenge the familiar practice of electing four stop signs in each direction by showing that it is not a Nash equilibrium for all drivers to abide by. Alternatively, we prove that electing only three stop signs at each four-way crossroad induces universal abidance as a unique symmetric equilibrium. This equilibrium enjoys significant savings in drivers' time, infrastructure costs, carbon emissions, and police expenditure. For example, for carbon emission reduction alone, the new mechanism is estimated to save at least 2.7 days of gas consumption annually." • HOW "FREE" IS FREE RIDING IN CIVIL WARS? Violence, Insurgency, and the Collective Action Problem -- The authors use data from Vietnam and the Greek Civil War to illustrate that "free riding" in civil wars may not be costless, that it may in fact be as costly not to participate as it is to participate. This explains the apparently high ability of insurgents to generate and maintain the risky collective action of rebellion. • Managing the socio-ecology of very large rivers: Collective choice rules in IWRM narratives -- Good example of a two country (two system) comparative approach -- Uses the Q methodology and Ostrom's IAD framework to evaluate integrated water resources management in China's Yellow River and the Ganges in India, and finds fundamental similarities in approaches. Democracy and Dictatorship Required Przeworski, et al. "Chapter one: Democracies and Dictatorship." Democracies aand Development: Political Institutions and Well Being in the World, 1950-1990. pages 13-30. The authors present a model of democracy defined primarily by contested elections or contestation. While dictatorships 4 Readings List Introduction to Comparative Politics: POLS 3311 Fall 2022 and hybrid regimes may hold elections, the distinction is the degree of contestation - that is, are the elections truly competitive. They propose rules for determining if there is true contestation. Przeworski defines democracy as "a system in which parties lose elections." More importantly in terms of their rules, democracy is a system in which the sitting government sometimes loses elections. Their three rules are, essentially, election outcomes have some degree of uncertainty before the election with some nontrivial chance the governing party will lose, elections can not be overturned after the fact to prevent the winner from assuming oce, and oceholders must not prevent new elections. Gandhi, Jennifer. "The World of Dictatorial Institutions: Introduction". Political Institutions Under Dictatorship. In the introduction to Political Institutions Under Dictatorship, Jennifer Gandhi addresses the core question of defining the term. Ultimately, after analyzing the historical background and other attempts at definition, like Przeworski et al, she settles on contested elections as the defining dierence between dictatorships and democracies. Democracies have them; dictatorships don't. Page 9's comparison between the Lockean view of democracy and the current (scientifically validated) view of dictatorship is important to those wishing to compare the economic outcomes of the two types of government. Bueno de Mesquita, Bruce and Alastair Smith. "The Rules of Politics." The Dictator's Handbook. pages 1-3. De Mesquita and Smith argue against the notion that dictators are monolithic, unaccountable rulers with absolute power and argue that instead dictators hold power through the assistance of a "winning coalition" drawn from the "selectorate," or the subset of citizens with the power to change rulers. Recommended Boix, Carles. The Roots of Democracy. pages 1-20. Boix examines the waves of democratization and their underlying causes. He notes that inequality of wealth/income makes democracy less likely as wealthy minorities are likely to oppose attempts by poor majorities to create a democracy for redistributive purposes. *2 Presidentialism and Parliamentarism 2.1 Presidentialism and Parliamentarism: Required Linz, Juan J. "The Perils of Presidentialism." 1990. Linz makes the case that Presidential systems are more likely to experience breakdowns in democracy or lapses in constitutional continuity. Shugart and Mainwaring. "Presidentialism, and Democracy: A Critical Appraisal." 1997. Shugart and Mainwaring oer a response to the ideas in the Linz paper and generally find that the perils Linz attributes to Presidentialism are better explained by other specifics of the Presidential and Parliamentary systems examined. 2.2 Presidentialism and Parliamentarism: Recommended Cheibub, Jose. "Presidential, Parliamentary, and Mixed Democracies" Chapter 2 in Presidentialism, Parliamentarism, and Democracy. Excellent resource for questions about dierences between 5 Readings List Introduction to Comparative Politics: POLS 3311 Fall 2022 Presidential and Parliamentary Systems. Siaro. "Comparative presidencies: The inadequacy of the presidential, semi-presidential and parliamentary distinction." Siaro argues that issues with the Parliamentary-Presidential distinction, particularly with regard to the semi-presidential cases are partly responsible for the lack of consensus on the Linz vs Shugart and Mainwaring debate. He suggests a new breakdown with four types to help provide clearer definition. Ganghof. "Designing Democratic Constitutions: The Search for Optimality." Ganghof explores the trade-os in dierent locations of executive and legislative power especially with regard to producing clear election alternatives and stable cabinet governments. 3 Electoral and Party Systems 3.1 Electoral and Party Systems: Required Bello. "Cleaning Up Latin American Democracy." The Economist. 2015. Interesting take on the interaction between the parliamentary/presidential institutional design and the electoral systems in Latin America, where strong presidents combined with PR electoral systems that work well in parliamentary systems lead to lack of consensus building and generally poor, unrepresentative governance. Powell, G. Bingham, Jr. "Majoritarian and Proportional Visions." Chapter 1. Elections as Instruments of Democracy. pages 3-19. Provides a good grounding in the distinctions between majoritarian and proportional representation. Figure 1.1 provides a good typology of specific desired outcomes. Figure 1.2 provides an understanding of the operation of PR and majoritarian systems that can tie to those desired results. At its simplest, majoritarian systems are good for producing stable and strong but accountable governments, while PR systems deliver a higher degree of representation, especially for small minorities, at the expense of less accountability and more instability. The author provides more depth and nuance. 3.2 Electoral and Party Systems: Recommended If you are writing on this topic, this article is STRONGLY recommended Anonymous. "Democratic Deficit." The Economist. 1995. This article raises some interesting points in favor of changing the British system from an FPTP system to a proportional representation system. Beware - it is thoroughly one-sided focusing on the weakness of an electoral system that has served the UK well in many respects, notably both political and economic stability. Still, it does a good job of explaining the basic dierences between the systems, provides some specific arguments in favor of a change in the British case, and most importantly is thought provoking and may provide good questions for further research. Schuster, et al. "Seat biases of apportionment methods for proportional representation." The introduction to this paper gives a good background on the types of seat assignment methods in proportional representation systems (d'Hondt/Jeerson, Hamilton/Hare, Webster/Sainte-Legue in particular). Later in the paper, some of the actual formulas are provided which may be useful for reference. 6 Readings List Introduction to Comparative Politics: POLS 3311 Fall 2022 3.3 Electoral and Party Systems: Potential Readings for Papers For these, you will want to focus on the abstract, conclusion, and introduction. The explanation in other parts of the paper may be useful in places, but without the mathematical game theory background may not mean much. Cox is relatively good at plain language explanations in the abstract, intro and conclusion. Cox, Gary W. "SNTV and d'Hondt are equivalent." 1991. Cox argues, and presents a formal model showing mathematically, that the single non-transferable vote plurality rule system produces the same outcomes as the d'Hondt system of proportional representation, holding other key items constant. This has two points. As stated by Cox, this one simple illustration focusing on very specific systems at opposite extremes demonstrates the confusion around core concepts. In particular, the dierences between majoritarian and PR systems are often about other elements than the core PR/majoritarian distinction. Cox, Gary W. "Centripetal and Centrifugal Incentives in Electoral Systems." 1990. Cox examines some of the specific elements that produce dierent tendencies toward centrist (centripetal) and extremist (centrifugal) tendencies in electoral systems. Unsurprisingly given the "SNTV and d'Hondt are equivalent" piece, he finds that dierences in district magnitude, number of votes per voter, and treatment of partial abstention are important determinants of the results.
