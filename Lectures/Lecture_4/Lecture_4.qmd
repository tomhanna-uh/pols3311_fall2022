**"...the theory of collective action is** \textbf{\textit{the}} central subject of political science."

**"core justification for the state"**

## Why is collective choice a problem?

-   Collective vs private goods

                  + Optimal use - externalities in private goods
                  + Efficient use - incentives in collective goods

-   Rational individual choices don't sum to rational group outcomes for either set of problems for different reasons

-   Examples in collective goods:

                  + Prisoner's dilemma 
                  + Condorcet Paradox
                  + Arrow's impossibility theorem
