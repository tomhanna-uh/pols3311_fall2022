## Conflict, Trade, and Globalization

-   Several explanations of democratic peace focus on the role of international markets
-   Liberal peace makes the benefits of trade to common people central
-   Capitalist peace makes the benefit of trade to powerful elites central
-   Both rely on wealth produced through trade outweighing wealth from war...

## Simple answers

## Gains from trade

-   Mercantilism - sell stuff, get gold, don't buy stuff (except for the elite)

-   Absolute advantage - one country is better able to produce a good than another country

[Absolute Advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absoluteadvantage.asp)

-   Competitive advantage - different countries specialize to optimize absolute advantage

What if one country has absolute advantage in all goods?

## Comparative Advantage

[Comparative advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp)

What if the countries have the same comparative advantage?

## New Trade Theory

-   Paul Krugman 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics for New Trade Theory

-   Countries with the same comparative advantages can gain from trade because:

          + Economies of scale
          + Consumer preferences

## The case for trade

-   Comparative advantage is regularly observed in operation. Large scale empirical evidence.
-   Some producers lose - the pie makers in one country and the chocolate cake makers in the other
-   But there is overall benefit First issue - what about those producers?

## What about the losers from trade?

Given comparative advantage, it is economically more efficient to maintain free trade and pay the domestic producers that are harmed than to have trade barriers to protect domestic producers.

This is the core of the economic case made by advocates of globalization.

## Globalization issues

Trade is good for the general welfare, but it is claimed that:

-   Trade increases conflict
-   Trade only benefits the wealthy / Trade increases inequality
-   Trade increases environmental problems

## Globalization issues: Conflict

Trade is good for the general welfare, but it is claimed that:

-   Trade increases conflict (mixed)

                  + "The vast majority of the extant literature on trade and conflict focuses on bilateral trade to determine whether commerce has a pacifying effect upon pairs of states. We argue that this focus neglects a critical role of international trade: creating tension between states that sell similar goods to the global market."^[Chatagnier, & Kavaklı, K. C. (2017). From Economic Competition to Military Combat: Export Similarity and International Conflict. The Journal of Conflict Resolution, 61(7), 1510–1536.]
                  + "Using commodity-level trade data from 1962 to 2000, we show that countries that produce and sell similar goods are generally more likely to fight..." 

## Globalization issues: Conflict

Trade is good for the general welfare, but it is claimed that:

-   Trade increases conflict (mixed)

          + Generally the evidence is consistent with the liberal/capitalist/democratic peace. 
          + In specific cases, trade creates conditions ripe for conflict.
          + Specifically, direct competition may create conflict

## Globalization issues: Distributional issues

-   Trade only benefits the wealthy
-   Trade creates inequality
-   Trade works best when combined with domestic liberalization

## Globalization issues: Distributional issues

-   Trade only benefits the wealthy

          + Empirically not the case. 
          + Lots of solid evidence over years of research. 
          + Massive increases in consumer choice and prices.^[United Nations. "Globalization meets the Millennium Development Goals." World Economic and Social Survey 2017 , pp 73-95. https://doi.org/10.18356/b16f4c86-en]

-   Trade creates inequality - Sort of.

        + Mathematical effect of growth - if real income doubles for everyone at all levels, the gap still doubles. Who benefits most? 
        + When trade is combined with bad domestic policies, the benefits can be poorly distributed. Trade works best when combined with domestic liberalization.^[Topalova. (2010). Factor Immobility and Regional Impacts of Trade Liberalization Evidence on Poverty from India. American Economic Journal. Applied Economics, 2(4), 1–41. https://doi.org/10.1257/app.2.4.1] 

## Globalization issues: Environmental

-   Trade causes environmental problems
-   Race to the bottom in environmental regulations
-   Increased production generally increases pollution

## Globalization issues: Environmental

Trade causes environmental problems?

-   Race to the bottom in environmental regulations - mixed evidence, more positive

          + California effect and race to the top

-   Increased production and pollution

          + Increased production generally - increased economic activity, but more efficient technology
