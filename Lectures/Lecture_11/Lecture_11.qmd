## Overview



## Normative concerns: Broad representation and avoiding extremism

**Powell**: "This work is explicitly driven by a normative concern: the claim of democracies to be governments in which the people participate in policy making." **Broad proportional reprentation of all positions**

**Cox**: "the degree to which they create either centripetal or centrifugal incentives. Centripetal incentives lead political parties (or candidates) to advocate centrist policies; centrifugal incentives, on the other hand, lead to the advocacy of more or less extreme positions." **Extremism versus centrism**
