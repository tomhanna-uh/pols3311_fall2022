## Why are economic development and political development correlated?

Richer[^1] countries are more likely to be democratic.

[^1]: Defining rich as higher total national income (GDP) or as higher median income

Democratic countries are more likely to be rich.

Why?

## Why are economic development and political development correlated?

General Possibilities:

Democracy leads to economic development.

Economic development leads to democratization.

Something else leads to both.

1. Security for investment^[It is important to understand that investment doesn't just include business investment. Personal investment in education and skill building are affected by the same incentives and disincentives.]
        
        1. Constraining the executive creates security against the state
        2.  Political stability - democracy reduces civil strife
        
2.  Selectorate theory
3.  Stationary bandit incentives

## Selectorate Theory

1. Democratic leaders satisfy W with public goods
2. Reduce costs of private production - improvements in public goods 
2. Improves investment security - security as public good 
3. Both - shifting from redistribution of private goods from S to W, to general investment in public goods 

## Stationary Bandit incentives

"democratic political leaders are just as self-interested as the stationary bandit and will use any expedient to obtain majority support"^[(Olson 1993, p.570)]

Making the electorate better off improves re-election chances^[ibid.]

1. Leaders have incentive to invest in public goods to ensure future growth
2. Protection creates incentives for citizens to invest more

Modernization theory: economic security allows people to consider nonmaterial desires

-   Similar to Maslow's hierarchy of needs from psychology

                  1. Physical needs
                  2. Security needs

                  3m. Maslow: Love and belonging, Self-esteem, self-actualization
                  3p. Politics: Civil society belonging, participation, self-determination, freedom

    ======= 3. Other needs: Freedom, self-determination, self-government

-   Political participation has costs

                  + Dictator's Handbook rules

## What other factors might contribute to both?
