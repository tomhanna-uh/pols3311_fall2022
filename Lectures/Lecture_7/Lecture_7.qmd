## James Madison on Democracy

"The essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse." -- 1787

"Place three individuals in a situation wherein the interest of each depends on the voice of the others, and give to two of them an interest opposed to the rights of the third. Will the latter be secure? The prudence of every man would shun the danger. The rules & forms of justice suppose & guard against it. Will two thousand in a like situation be less likely to encroach on the rights of one thousand?" -- 1821
