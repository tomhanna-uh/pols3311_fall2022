## What is science?
                
                + Based on proof
                + Scientific Method
                + Falsifiability
                
                
## What is science? Based on proof
                
**Based on proof**

+ *Positive* not *normative*
                
        + Based on physical proof that can be empirically tested
        + About explaining the world as it is
        + Not based on ideas about what "should be"
                

                
## What is science?

**Scientific Method**

1. Define a *research question*
2. Make predictions - *hypothesis*
3. Gather *data*

                + Experiments
                + Observations 
                
4. Analyze the data to *test* the hypothesis
5. Draw conclusions


## What is science?

**Falsifiability - testing the hypothesis**

+ Karl Popper (1902-1994) - critical rationalism
+ hypotheses (pl.) should be testable **empirically**
+ false hypotheses are *rejected*
+ hypotheses not rejected are *confirmed* as *approximately true*
                

## Applying science to human behavior

**Social Sciences - Behavioral Sciences**

+ Economics
               
                + Political Economy
+ Political Science

+ Psychology

                + Social Psychology
+ Sociology

+ Anthropology

## Applying science to politics

+ political philosophy (theory) ![](socrates.jpg){width=4%}
+ American politics ![](science.png){width=4%}![](socrates.jpg){width=4%}
+ comparative politics ![](science.png){width=4%}
+ international relations ![](science.png){width=4%}
+ political economy ![](science.png){width=4%}

## More on the comparative method

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Types of research**

+ Experiment
+ Observational

                + Case study (single case)
                + Statisticial (large-n)
                + Comparative (small-n, can be large-n)

## More on the comparative method: Method of Difference

A B C D occur together with w x y z B C D occur together with x y z ------------------------------------------------------ Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, or a part of the cause of w.

## Assignment and questions

**Provide 3 to 4 scientific questions related to your discussion post topic**

        + You are not expected to answer the question
        + You don't need to provide a lot of background
        + One clearly worded sentence for each question
        + You should not need to write more than 4 sentences total to complete this assignment
        + The sentences should be clearly written, with good grammar and spelling
        + Copy your discussion post to the the page. You may want to edit it for grammar and spelling. 
        + There will be further assignments using your discussion post as a basis. If you want to change topics, you may do so now. 



## Assignment and questions
**Example: Many discussion posts responded to the repeal of Roe v. Wade**

**Non-scientific questions:**
**In other wordes, these sorts of questions will get zero credit. Not because they are not worthwhile questions, but because they are not susceptible to scientific resolution.**

        + Did the decision violate rights?
        + Was this case properly decided legally?
        + Is there a right to abortion in the Constitution?
        + When does life begin?
        + Should Samuel Alito be impeached?
        + Should Harry Blackmun be canonized?

## Assignment and questions

**Good scientific question:**

Does the gender of litigators (lawyers) affect judicial decisions?
