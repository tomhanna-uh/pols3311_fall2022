## What is science? Based on proof
                
**Based on proof**

+ *Positive* not *normative*
                
        + Based on physical proof that can be empirically tested
        + About explaining the world as it is
        + Not based on ideas about what "should be"
                

                
## What is science?

**Scientific Method**

1. Define a *research question*
2. Make predictions - *hypothesis*
3. Gather *data*

                + Experiments
                + Observations 
                
4. Analyze the data to *test* the hypothesis
5. Draw conclusions


## What is science?

**Falsifiability - testing the hypothesis**

+ Karl Popper (1902-1994) - critical rationalism
+ hypotheses (pl.) should be testable **empirically**
+ false hypotheses are *rejected*
+ hypotheses not rejected are *confirmed* as *approximately true*

## More on the comparative method

**Types of research**

+ Experiment
+ Observational

                + Case study (single case)
                + Statisticial (large-n)
