## Followup from Monday

-   Politics main concern isn't the welfare of the people. Why do I emphasize this?

          + You can't assume the state is representative of all the people or even cares about "the people's interests"
          + You can't assume the state is benevolent

-   Scientific questions - will cover today

## What is science?

-   Based on proof
-   Scientific Method
-   Falsifiability

## What is science? Based on proof

-   *Positive* not *normative*

-   Based on physical proof that can be empirically tested

-   About explaining the world as it is

-   Not based on ideas about what "should be"

## What is science? Scientific Method

1.  Define a *research question*

2.  Make predictions - *hypothesis*

3.  Gather *data*

                 + Experiments
                 + Observations 

4.  Analyze the data to *test* the hypothesis

5.  Draw conclusions

## What is science?

**Falsifiability - testing the hypothesis**

-   Karl Popper (1902-1994) - critical rationalism
-   hypotheses (pl.) should be testable **empirically**
-   false hypotheses are *rejected*
-   hypotheses not rejected are *confirmed* as *approximately true*

## Applying science to human behavior

**Social Sciences - Behavioral Sciences**

-   Economics

                  + Political Economy

-   Political Science

-   Psychology

                  + Social Psychology

-   Sociology

-   Anthropology

## Applying science to politics

-   political philosophy (theory) ![](socrates.jpg){width="4%"}
-   American politics ![](science.png){width="4%"}![](socrates.jpg){width="4%"}
-   comparative politics ![](science.png){width="4%"}
-   international relations ![](science.png){width="4%"}
-   political economy ![](science.png){width="4%"}
-   political psychology ![](science.png){width="4%"}
-   judicial behavior - not the same as "law" ![](science.png){width="4%"}
-   policy ![](gear.png){width="4%"} ![](science.png){width="4%"}
-   ...

## More on the comparative method

**Types of research**

-   Experiment - random assignment, manipulation, control and treatment group

-   Observational

                  + Case study (single case, n = 1)
                  + Comparative (small-n, can be large-n)
                  + Statisticial (large-n)

## Research Questions: The First Step

**Non-scientific questions:**

        + Did the decision repealing Roe v Wade violate rights? (Political Philosophy - POLS 3310, 3349, 4344)
        + Was this case properly decided legally? (Law - POLS 3356,3357)
        + Is there a right to abortion in the Constitution? (Law - POLS 3356,3357)
        + When does life begin? (Philosopy/Theology - PHIL 1301, PHIL3351)
        + Should Samuel Alito be impeached?  (American politics/Constitutional Law - POLS 3364,3356)
        + Should Harry Blackmun be canonized? (Theology - Check with the appopriate church)

## Research Questions: The First Step

**Good scientific questions**

1.  About cause and effect

                 + "Does X cause Y?" 
                 + "What causes Y?"
                 + NOT "What is the value of Y?" - just measurement

2.  Should be measurable

3.  It should be specific at least as to the outcome (Y, dependent variable)

4.  "Why" questions are most interesting: "Why do different countries adopt a different policy with regard to Y?"

## Research Questions: The First Step

**Good scientific question:**

Does the gender of litigators (lawyers) affect judicial decisions?

## Assignment and questions

**Provide 3 to 4 scientific questions related to your discussion post topic**

        + Non-scientific questions will receive zero credit. This isn't flexible and it isn't a matter of agreement or disagreement. 
        + You are not expected to answer the question
        + You don't need to provide a lot of background
        + One clearly worded sentence for each question
        + You should not need to write more than 4 new sentences total to complete this assignment. Eight total if you write a long topic/discussion post.
        + The sentences should be clearly written, with good grammar and spelling.
        + Copy your discussion post to the the page or write a new short topic post. You may need to edit it for grammar and spelling. 
        + There will be further assignments using your discussion post or your new topic "post" as a basis. If you want to change topics, you may do so now.
