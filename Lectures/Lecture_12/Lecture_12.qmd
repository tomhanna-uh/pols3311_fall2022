## Recap: Important for today

Democracy - contestation

                - competition
                - chance of loss
                - multiple competitors

Another way of thinking about contestation: Differing viewpoints are able to *contest* the election and be represented.

Presidential vs Parliamentary

                + Location of executive power
                + In parliamentary systm, the legislature chooses the head of government from its own members
                


## Recap

Majoritarian vs Proportional Representation

**Choice of electoral systam influences the selection of head of government in parliamentary system**

Majoritarian 

                + Single member districts
                + Majority/plurality winner
                + Voters choose specific candidates
                + FPTP is a common, simple example

Proportional Representation

                + Multiple member districts (Magnitude 2+)
                + Seats awarded proportional to party vote
                + Closed list - vote by party, party chooses specific members
                + Open lsit - vote by party, voters choose specific members
                
## What happens if?

In parliamentary systems, the Parliament chooses a Prime Minister and Cabinet.

What happens in a PR system if no party gets 50% of the seats in Parliament?

## Apportionment of votes

+ May be a minimum vote threshhold
+ Different methods benefit different size parties
+ largest remainder method - example, Hare quota method

Exceeding $\frac{total votes}{total seats}$ guarantees a seat
                
+ Divisor methods - example, d'Hondt method
                
$quot = \frac{V}{s + 1}$

V = total votes received by party; s = number of seats party received so far; Largest quotient gets the next seat

## Party systems

+ Nonpartisan (small countries, for specific offices, or nondemocratic)
+ One Party (non-democratic)
+ Dominant Party (flawed democracy or non-democratic)
+ Two Party 

                + de jure (likely flawed democracy or non-democratic)
                + de facto - Duverger or similar natural outcome (may be democratic)

+ Multiple party (may be democratic)
