## Previous material on dictatorships

+ Dictatorships are defined by a lack of what?
+ Dictatorship is a catch-all for regimes that are not democratic (Gandhi among others)
+ We also refer to autocracies and non-democracies (plus other terms)
+ This includes hybrid regimes between democracy and autocracy

+ Dictatorships may have elections, legislatures, judiciaries, parties, and other features expected in democracies

## Types by degree

+ Liberal Democracies

                + Liberal Democracy (VDem)
                + Flawed Democracy 

+ Anocracy / Mixed regimes

                + Electoral Democracy (Vdem)
                + Electoral Autocracy (VDem)
                + Competitive Autocracy 

+ Closed autocracy (VDem)
+ Hereditary Monarch (Polity)

## Who defines this?

+ Polity (Center for Systemic Peace)

                + 21- point scale
                + hereditary monarch (-10)
                + consolidated democracy (+10)
                + Autocracies (-10 to -6), anocracies (-5 to +5), democracies (+6 to +10)
                + 6 measures of executive recruitment, constraints, political competition, and institutional quality
                

+ Varieties of Democracy Project 

                + "Question: How can the political regime overall be classified considering the competitiveness of access to power (polyarchy) as well as liberal principles?"
                + 0: Closed autocracy 
                + 1: Electoral autocracy (multi-party elections)
                + 2: Electoral democracy (free and fair, multi-party elections, lacking other features of liberal democracy)
                + 3: Liberal democracy



## Types by institution

+ Hereditary Monarchy
+ Military Dictatorship
+ Civilian Dictatorship
+ Oligarchy (Single party)
+ Revolutionary 
+ Theocracy


## Selectorate Theory

+ Residents (full population)
+ Selectorate (S)

                + Nominal selectorate - Interchangeables 
                + Real selectorate - Influentials 
                
+ Winning Coalition (W) - Essentials

+ Goal: small W and large pool of Interchangeables

## Selectorates: Regime Classification

Democracy - large coalition regime

                + Large winning coalition
                + Leader uses public goods to satisfy W

Dictatorship - small coalition regime

                + Small winning coalition
                + Leader uses private good to satisfy W
                
## Dictator's Handbook: Five Rules

1. Keep the Winning Coalition (W) small
2. Keep the Interchangeables pool large.
3. Redistribute from the masses to supporters (W)
4. Pay W just enough. Satisfy but don't empower.
5. Never redistribute from W to  the masses.
