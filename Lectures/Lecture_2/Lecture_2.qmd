                2. What makes "the state" different from other organizations or institutinos?
                3. Did the readings or discussion post raise any scientific questions for you? If so, write the question.

## What is Politics: Discussion Posts

        "I believe that the last time politics impacted my life directly was four days ago, on August 24. Indeed, that day, President Joe Biden announced that he plans to forvige the debts of some student loan borrowers. As a student, this clearly impacts me because if I am eligible for this student loan forgiveness, it could be a big help!"
        "Sleepy Joe's Debt Forgiveness - Politics has impacted my life every step of the way yet I have only recently been made aware of it. On August 24th President Bidens three-part plan was announced to relieve student debt up to $20,000 for pell grant borrowers. As a pell grant recipient, this directly encourages me to be more optimistic about my just started, yet costly, undergrad education. Seeking further education is never simple, especially when originating from low-income areas, yet decisions such as this encourage students like me to complete our undergrad and perhaps go beyond, thus fundamentally changing our future job prospects, areas of knowledge, world influence, and potential."

        "The most recent impact politics has had on me is on a much smaller scale than it has been for me in the past. Since this semester started I have been very active in the Mock Trial organization as a team leader, and my colleagues and I have been making crucial decisions for the group. We somewhat operate as a small democracy, taking votes from our team members to see what would be best for us as a whole."

                "Politics has directly impacted me and my family through the TPS policies concerning Salvadoreans. Since both my parents receive protection to work and live in the U.S through this service, it was very concerning when it was declared to end last year, thankfully it has been extended for a bit, but this will still impact my family, forcing my mother to go back to her country, leaving me and my brother behind and facing dangerous circumstances herself."
                "The last time politics impacted my life directly was this summer. In my search for employment over the break political policies like that which restricts international students from seeking non-CPT or OPT employment outside of campus determined the types of jobs, I could work before the search even began. It determined how many hours I could work and ultimately how much I would be paid."

                + I drove 1/4 mile on city owned roads to a Metro transit center paying about 1 penny in federal taxes on my fuel

                + I walked from the Metro stop to my desk in the taxpayer funded, University of Houston campus

## What is politics?

                + "...the subset of human behavior that involves the use of power" (Clark, Foundations of Comparative Politics)
                + What is power?
                + We will deal with one type: state power

## What is "the state"?

Not state as in Texas - state as in government at any level

**The organized, coercive use of phyisical force commonly accepted as legitimate**

Do our findings apply to other behavior (the firm, markets, voluntary organizations, churches)?

Can non-state organizations provide examples to understand the state?

What about the interaction between the state and non-state entities?

## What is Comparative Politics?

                + John Stuart Mill (1806-1873): Method of Difference and Method of Similarity (First step)
                + Case study (few cases)
                + Quantitative (many cases)
                + Examine variables that are similar or different to one another
                + Examine variables across time or geographic differences 
                + Compare different states, nations, regions
                + Compare the same state at different times

## What is Comparative Politics? Method of Difference and Method of Similarity

**Method of Difference**

                + Starts with states that differ in the dependent variable result (the outcome)
                + They should be as similar in everything else as possible
                + Find the one other thing that is different
                + That is the cause
                

**Method of Similarity**

                + Starts with states with the same dependent variable result (outcome)
                + They should be as different in everything else as possible
                + Find the one other thing that is the same
                + That is the cause
